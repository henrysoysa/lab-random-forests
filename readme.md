# Lab | Random Forests

For this lab, you will be using the CSV files provided in the `files_for_lab` folder.

### Instructions

- Apply the Random Forest algorithm to predict the `TARGET_B`. Please note that this column suffers from class imbalance. Fix the class imbalance using upsampling.
- Discuss the model predictions and it's impact in the business scenario. Is the cost of a false positive equals to the cost of the false negative? How much the money the company will not earn because of missclassifications made by the model?
- Sklearn classification models are trained to maximize the accuracy. However, another error metric will be more relevant here. Which one?  Please checkout
[make_scorer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html#sklearn.metrics.make_scorer) alongside with [GridSearchCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) in order to train the model to maximize the error metric of interest in this case.
